# Hungry Enough

A demo iOS app for using Yelp API to get nearby restaurants. I'm so hungryyyy!

`SwiftLint` must be installed for code style checking.

#### Credentials ####

As this app use Google Maps API and Yelp API, it requires Google Maps API Key and Yelp Access Token/Secret Key to be modified. Follow [this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17393053/where-to-set-environment-variables-for-app) to enter `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `YELP_CLIENT_ID`, `YELP_CLIENT_SECRET` to get the app works.

#### Installation ####

The source code is built using Swift 3.1 and above, XCode 8.2 and above with Carthage 0.22 and above. Please do:
```
carthage bootstrap --platform ios --cache-builds
```

after checked out.

If you need to add any new dependency, please add to `Cartfile` then do:
```
carthage update --platform ios --cache-builds
```

If you encounter any problem with cached artifacts between multiple machines, you can consider adding ` --no-use-binaries` flag to above commands.
